# HandsOfMyZig
Hands off my code Ziglang!  You claim to be above stupid symantic debates, but then enforce aribitrary rules that many don't like.  Consistency is in style always will be project dependent, enforcing spaces won't change that.  Different naming standards, file structure, and general design will always differentiate code from different projects.  You trust developers for that but whine because developers want to seperate distinctly condition and execution?  Of course I wouldn't mind if I agreed s these design decisions, but unfortunately I don't.  So time to make my own.
Will be based on cmdFmt from main.zig probably
